<rpw name="PresentationName">Sample Iteration Plan</rpw>: Construction Phase</h2>
<p>This illustration shows the relationship of the workflows in an early
construction iteration. It is constructed from the Workflow Details as they
would appear at that time. The intent is to indicate dependencies and show where
workflows occur in parallel. The lengths of the bars in the chart (indicating
duration) have no absolute significance. For example, it is not intended to
convey that Plan the Integration and Plan Test must have the same duration.
There is also no intention to suggest the application of a uniform level of
effort across the duration of the workflows. An indication of the relative
effort can be seen in the<a href="http://www.ts.mah.se/RUP/RationalUnifiedProcess/process/ovu_proc.htm" "=""> Process Overview</a>. You
can navigate to the corresponding Workflow Detail pages from each line of the
chart by clicking on the Workflow Detail name. This illustration was created
from a <a href="http://www.ts.mah.se/RUP/RationalUnifiedProcess/prjtmpl/mgmt/mp_conit.htm" "="">Microsoft Project Plan</a>.</p>
<p><br>
Note that there is significant continuing design work shown in this iteration,
indicating that it is early in the construction cycle. In later construction
iterations, this will diminish as design work completes, when the design work
remaining will relate to Change Requests (defects and enhancements) that impact
design. Requirements discovery and refinement is shown as complete at this
stage, the remaining effort relating entirely to the management of change.</p>

<h4>Result</h4>
<p>The main result of a late iteration in the construction phase is that more
functionality is added, which yields an increasingly more complete system. The
results of the current iteration are made visible to developers to form the
basis of development for the subsequent iteration.<br>
